        "    * \"r\" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, an error occurs if the file does not exist\n",
        "    * \"a\" - Append - Opens a file for appending (adding data to the end of a file), creates the file if it does not exist\n",
        "    * \"w\" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist; overwrites all data already in the file.\n",
        "    * \"x\" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists\n",
        "* In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode:\n",
        "    * \"t\" - Text - Default value. File has letters and numbers; each line terminated with a linefeed\n",
        "    * \"b\" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images). File has unprintable characters, such as photos videos, and sound files.\n"
